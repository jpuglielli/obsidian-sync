**Test to Learn**
The most effective way to learn is to test yourself — trying to recall information _without_ the source material. This consistently outperforms passive review (rereading, highlighting) in studies.

**Desirable difficulty:** The harder the retrieval, the stronger the learning. For example, delaying your first test forces deeper processing. But there's a sweet spot — wait too long and you've fully forgotten, which isn't productive.

**The fluency illusion:** Rereading feels effective because the material seems familiar, but recognition isn't the same as recall. This false sense of mastery is why most people default to passive study.

**Forward testing effect:** Testing yourself on material you _haven't learned yet_ can improve your ability to retain it once you do encounter it — like building a road before the destination exists.

**Actual useful retrieval methods**
1. **Free recall** — after reading a section, close the book and try to write down everything you can remember. No cues, no prompts. This is the one that beat concept mapping in the study I mentioned.
	- In a study, this much outperformed the other methods, even though the students think it would not
2. **The question-book method** — create questions about the main ideas of each section, then answer them later. The chapter emphasizes that good questions target the _core idea_, not just surface details rephrased as questions.
3. **Self-generated challenges** — going beyond questions to actually _applying_ or _producing_ something from memory. For a programmer, this would be like closing the docs and trying to implement something from scratch.

**Feedback:** Check your answers after retrieval, but the act of struggling to recall is itself where most of the learning happens — even failed attempts strengthen later retention.
